### 2018/Jan: Master's Works and Theses at IAMAS

I started to researching about "Attempt to create music with multilayered temporal structures and possibility of embodiments for player and audience". Finaly, I made one master's works and video and one master's theses.

#### About Master's Works.

My master's works is namaed "Music for multilayered temporal structures". It have a 3 peices of score as known as jazz style "lead sheet" and instruction about "How to play each songs for musician". you can read that follow URL.

And I had take video for the experiment of how the musician would actually play such a song. You can watch below. This recording was that each musicians NEVER USE CLICK for keeping rhythm. Musicians take corabolate for understanding strucures of my concept via instruction at my works.This video is result of Musicians had take cooperation for understanding structures of my concept via instruction at my works.

#### About Master's theses

And I have Already shared my master's theses "Attempt to create music with multilayered temporal structures and possibility of embodiments for player and audience" via github. I introduce English version of my master's theses abstract here.

> This research deals with two subjects. One is about the attempt to create music using two or more tempos in a specific structure. The other concerns the possibility of embodying music for audiences and performers.  
>
> The rhythm of contemporary popular music is dominated by common rhythms such as a four-four time or three-four time. I infer that this is because the current environment of music creation such like both music theory and DTM/MIDI is influenced by the music score system. But in the beginning of the 21st century, African-American musicians introduced intentional polyrhythmic sway and accent. This watershed in the history of rhythm is considered as important as the appearance of the mode system in jazz and atonality in modern music.
>
> This is the background that informs my research on rhythm. Rhythm has a diversity that cannot be captured by the current score system, and it has the possibility of updating how people experience music. And when we deal with the medium of sound, we cannot ignore the relationships between sound and technology, and sound and the physical body.
>
> In the body of paper, first I reinterpret the movement of music from jazz to popular music, and compare this in parallel to the movement from classical music to modern music. This approach that focuses on both movements can make clear the current state of music. In this approach, I focus polyrhythm and crossrhythm that has failed to be correctly understood in the context of Western music . Second, I consider variations of rhythm using polyrhythm and other complex rhythm in order to show how this is different and novel when compared with the currently performed rhythmic approach. Then, I show a possible way of how people can perform with my method of rhythm. I believe it is possible that this approach can contribute to music experience and lead to the creation of new acts of ''playing'' and ''listening''.
>
> This research concerns that diversity of rhythm, and is an attempt to discover new possibilities for the relationship between music and the physical body for the next generation.
